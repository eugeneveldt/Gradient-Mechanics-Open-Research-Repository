Based on the structure of your Gradientology README and the specific content of the **Gradient Mechanics** suite (Papers 1–16) and *Planogenesis* protocol, here is the tailored README for the **Gradient Mechanics** repository.

It highlights the shift from "theoretical treatises" to "computational protocols" (R-MEP) and "operational metrics."

## Introduction

**Gradient Mechanics** is the comprehensive universal calculus founded upon the doctrine of **Derivable Necessity**. It functions as the mathematical first derivative of the Gradientology ontology (), translating the static axioms of "Being" into the kinetic laws of "Doing."

While Gradientology establishes the *Equation of State* (), Gradient Mechanics derives the **Equation of Kinetics**:

This repository serves as the central operational hub for the framework's **16 Foundational Papers**, the **Three Laws of Gradient Dynamics**, and the **Relational Multi-Scale Protocol (R-MEP)** used to validate scalar invariance across cosmic, geologic, biological, and noetic systems.

## Key Derivations & Metrics

This repository hosts the proofs and tools for the "Dashboard of Existence," quantifying system dynamics via three derived instruments:

* 
**GM (Gradient Magnitude):** The measure of Drive (Input Power).


* 
**GSI (Gradient Stress Index):** The measure of Systemic Risk (Load vs. Limit).


* 
**RGG (Rate of Gradient Generation):** The measure of Evolutionary Velocity.



## Related Resources

For the complete derivation chain and empirical validation, refer to the associated resources:

* 
**Zenodo Data Suite:** [Gradient Mechanics Papers (1–16)] – Access the "Kinetic Derivations" suite, operational proofs, and the "Pretorius Gradient Data Suite" (CSV/JSON).


*

* **Gradientology Repository:** [Gradientology Foundations] – Access the static ontological Treatises (I–XV).

## Installation (R-MEP)

Unlike the purely theoretical Gradientology repository, this repository contains computational components for the **Relational Multi-Scale Protocol (R-MEP)**.

* 
**R-MEP Scripts:** Python/R scripts for extracting phase vectors and performing MEP iteration until variance .


* **Dependencies:** Requires standard scientific computing libraries (NumPy, SciPy, Pandas).

```bash
# Example installation (if applicable)
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/gradient-Mechanics.git
cd gradient-Mechanics
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## Usage Guidelines

Users are encouraged to engage with the materials for computational modeling, systems analysis, and ethical stewardship. When utilizing the framework:

1. 
**Measurement Purity Mandate:** Analysts must adhere to the blinding protocols; strictly no use of Mechanics-dependent data (e.g., absolute Newtonian masses) when calibrating the derived constants.


2. 
**Single-Shot Falsification:** Ensure any application respects the scalar invariance rule; parameters (, ) must hold across scales without arbitrary fine-tuning.


3. **Citation:** Cite the original source appropriately (Eugene Pretorius, 2026) and reference the specific Paper (1–16) or Treatise utilized.

## Contribution Policies

Contributions to refine the **R-MEP algorithms** or expand the **Empirical Anchor** datasets (e.g., crater distributions, orbital ratios) are welcome. To contribute:

* 
**Data Submission:** Ensure all datasets (CSVs) are normalized according to the base-10 discretization scheme.


* 
**Code Review:** Submit pull requests via GitHub; all code must pass the "Variance Convergence" check ().


* 
**Alignment:** Ensure submissions align with the *Three Laws of Gradient Dynamics*.
